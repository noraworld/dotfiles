# Setup for Windows
## Device
I assume you are using:

| Type | Name |
|---|---|
| Keyboard | Apple Magic Keyboard (JIS) |
| Mouse | Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 1850 |

Other devices could work fine, but that is not guaranteed.

## Requirements
- [Boot Camp Support Software](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1836)
- [KeySwap](https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/winnt/util/se228667.html)
- [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com)
- Windows Subsystem for Linux

## KeySwap
You should run KeySwap as an administrator and restart Windows to apply changes.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Left Win | Left Ctrl |
| CapsLock | Esc |
| F1 | CapsLock |
| Left Ctrl | Left Alt |

## Important notes
You should decrease the repeat rate in the keyboard properties.

`Control Panel` > `Keyboard` > `Keyboard Properties` > `Character repeat` > `Repeat rate`
