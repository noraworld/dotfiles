  <dd>All configuration works fine. New configuration will be added, and existing configuration will be fixed if bugs exist.</dd>
  <dt>Partially supported</dt>
  <dd>Some configuration may not work properly. For example, due to the lack of commands. These problems will be fixed, but it may take a while.</dd>

## Before the setup
You should move the following original dotfiles to somewhere else if they exist.

* `.bash_profile`
* `.bashrc`
* `.emacs.el`
* `.inputrc`
* `.vimrc`
* `.dir_colors`
* `.gitconfig`
* `.gitconfig.local`
* `.gitignore_global`

The following commands are used during the setup. Please install them.

* `curl`
* `git (>= 2.8)`

It is recommended to install Git `2.8` or higher.

## How to setup
Run the setup script. You need to change directories so you can run it in dotfiles directory.

```bash
$ cd path/to/dotfiles
$ bash setup.sh
$ source ~/.bash_profile
$ git refresh
$ bundle install
$ brew bundle install --global
```

Thatâ€™s all!

**NOTE**: If you face a problem that most commands show `Killed: 9` and do not work after running `brew bundle install --global`, just type `exit` to exit a shell and reopen it again. The terminal process probably [terminates with exit code 137](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/troubleshoot-terminal-launch), but it can be ignored. This causes when bash is updated.

## Dependencies
This dotfiles depends on the following.

* Bash
* Git version 2.8 or higher
* Ruby (version 2.5.1 or higher is recommended)
* Homebrew

## Others
* It is recommended to run the setup script every time new files are added.
* If you want to add your additional Git configuration, just add them to `gitconfig.local`.
